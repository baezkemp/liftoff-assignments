Burrow Application Project Outline
by the-egg
LiftOff Nov 2020

*Overview
Home information planner that includes types/sizes of air filters, lightbulbs, and batteries for appliances, devices, and fixtures in each room of a house, and how often they should be replaced. A one-stop shop for home maintenance information in an easy to access application.
Users will be able to create their own homes, add different appliances, fixtures, and devices by room and set reminders for when replacements are needed. The application makes it easy for homeowners, roommates, caregivers, and landlords to find replacement information while away from the house or at the store, where the required information might not be as easy to find.

*Features

- Create/Edit house: Users will be able to create a house or multiple houses to track the information for.
- Create/Edit room: Users will be able to create or edit a room within a house
- Create/Edit/Delete device: Users will be able to define the devices within the rooms of their house
